🎯 Problem Statement
Every Christmas, Santa Claus receives millions of letters from children around the world. The traditional manual processing of these letters creates several critical challenges:
📝 The Challenges

Manual Data Entry Bottleneck

Reading each letter individually is time-consuming
Extracting child information (name, location, gifts) manually is error-prone
Handwriting variations make it difficult to process consistently


Logistics Nightmare

Assigning deliveries to elves requires complex coordination
No real-time visibility into delivery status
Difficult to track which elf is delivering to which location


Scalability Issues

Processing volume increases every year
Limited workforce (only 5 elves!) to handle global deliveries
No system to optimize delivery routes


Communication Gap

Letters arrive via multiple channels (email, postal mail, etc.)
No centralized system to manage all incoming requests
Risk of missing children's wishes due to disorganization
