## 🧑‍🎄 Project Overview

**Santa App** is a festive yet powerful AI-driven application that automates the process of reading children’s letters, extracting key details, and managing gift deliveries through elves — all from a single command center.

The goal is to eliminate manual effort, reduce errors, and bring real-time visibility into Santa’s Christmas operations.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Every Christmas, Santa receives **millions of letters** from children across the globe.  
Handling these letters manually creates major challenges:

### 📝 Challenges

- **Manual Letter Processing**
  - Time-consuming to read each letter
  - Error-prone data extraction
  - Inconsistent handwriting and formats

- **Logistics Nightmare**
  - No structured elf assignment system
  - No real-time delivery visibility
  - Difficult to track progress

- **Scalability Issues**
  - Growing number of letters every year
  - Very limited workforce (only 5 elves!)
  - No workload optimization

- **Lack of Centralization**
  - Letters come from multiple sources
  - No single source of truth
  - Risk of missing children’s wishes
